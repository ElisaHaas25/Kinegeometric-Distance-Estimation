# Kinegeometric-Distance-Estimation
The kinegeometric distance posterior is given by a 3D probability density function in distance and velocity. Previously, the summary statistics have been calculated by sampling from the 3D distribution (Bailer-Jones 2023). It has been shown that the 3D sampling can be replaced by marginal 1D sampling in distance and 2D sampling in velocity, which requires less computation time (Bailer-Jones 2024). 

The notebook "test_sampling.ipynb" tests and compares the sampling of the 1D sampling of the marginal distance posterior and 2D sampling of the marginal velocity posterior to the 3D sampling.
